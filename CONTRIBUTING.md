# Contributing to NumGeomWorks Code Suite #

Welcome, NumGeomers! We're glad that you are reading this and want to help improve _NumGeomWorks_ Code Suite.

## Styleguides ##

### Git commit messages ###

- Commit messages should start with verbs and be consistent with past and present tenses (e.g., either "Fix a bug" or "Fixed a bug" is fine, but not "I fixed a bug")
- Try to be comprehensive regarding the message: Use a brief introduction with a more detailed description, see below
```sh
$ git commit -m "Fixed a bug regarding blah...
>
> more detailed information goes here"
```
- For minor changes, it is okay to commit your changes with a single-line message
